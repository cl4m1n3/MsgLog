<b>Recording of messages sent to the chat by the player.</b>
</p>

# Using
There is only one command in the plugin - <b>/getmsg</b> (permission for this command for PurePerms: <b>use.getmsg</b>)
<br>
<br>
<br>
to receive player messages, you must enter <b>/getmsg (player name) (number "from") (number "to")</b>

</p>
<br>
As a result, you will receive 5 player messages, in order from 1 to 5.

<br> 
You can also enter from 3 to 5. As you wish, this is limited only by the number of messages sent by this player.
